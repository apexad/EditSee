EditSee was a small project that I worked on a few years ago, and is in desperate need of a re-write from the ground up.  However, the concepts it used are still important.  Maybe even more important today then when EditSee was written.

It is a blog/content management system application that changes the way it all works.  EditSee is a front end tool, it does not have a seperate admin section.  Everything is edited in-line in the same spot it will appear or via a very simple popup.

It is written in all PHP with the micro ajax library xajax.  The tested database is MySQL, but EditSee was written to also support MS SQL, but this was not tested very well.

At some point I do plan to begin a ground up re-build of EditSee.
